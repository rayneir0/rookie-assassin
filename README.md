# Goal of Game:
A rookie assassin has been given the task to steal gold from the castle. However, he has never killed before, so to complete his task he will need to set off traps to get to the end of the dungeon. Hopefully, by then he will have the courage to face the final boss, the Captain of the Knights. May the odds be ever in his favour.
